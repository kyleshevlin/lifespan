# Lifespan Visual with React

Recently, I watched [Tim Urban's TED Talk on procrastination](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator?language=en). Near the end, he put up a visual where each week in a 90-year lifespan was a small circle. I immediately thought this could be a small application, and would give me a chance to practice using React and Redux.

Put in your birthdate and see how long you've lived, and how much longer you have to go (if you make it to 90, of course).
